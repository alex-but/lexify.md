# Business Requirements Document for Lexify.md

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
The purpose of this document is to outline the business requirements for the development of Lexify.md, a command-line tool for managing project vocabulary directly within the codebase.

### 1.2 Problem

In software development projects, maintaining consistent project vocabulary across codebases and documentation is challenging.

Manual processes or external tools for managing terminology are cumbersome and error-prone. There is a need for a streamlined solution that allows developers to manage project vocabulary directly within the codebase, improving collaboration and documentation quality.

### 1.2 Scope

**Lexify.md** is aimed at software developers and project teams. It aims to provide a simple and efficient way to manage project terminology within the codebase, ensuring consistency and clarity across codebases and documentation.

## 2. Business Objectives

### 2.1 Primary Objectives

- Ensure the tool is intuitive and user-friendly for developers with varying levels of command-line experience.
- Enable developers to easily add new terms with their definitions to the project glossary.
- Provide functionality to remove existing terms from the glossary when no longer relevant.
- Allow updating definitions of existing terms in the glossary to reflect changes in project terminology.

### 2.2 Secondary Objectives (Nice to Have)
- Automatically create links to glossary terms within project documentation to enhance readability and understanding.


## 3. Target Audience

### 3.1 User Profiles
#### 3.1.1 Junior Developers
- Junior developers who may not be familiar with project terminology and its significance.
#### 3.1.2 Senior Developers
- Senior developers responsible for maintaining project documentation and ensuring consistency in terminology.
#### 3.1.3 Project Managers
- Project managers who oversee multiple projects and require clear and consistent communication among team members.

### 3.2 User Needs
- Ability to easily add, remove, and update glossary terms from the command line.
- Seamless integration with existing project workflows and version control systems (e.g. git).
- Clear and concise error messages in case of invalid inputs or failures.

## 4. Functional Requirements

### 4.1 Command-Line Interface
- Lexify.md shall provide a command-line interface accessible via terminal commands.
- The command-line interface shall support commands for adding, removing, updating, and linking glossary terms.
- Lexify should be easy to install on Linux, Windows and Mac

### 4.2 Glossary Management
- Lexify.md shall allow users to add new terms with their definitions to the project glossary.
- Users shall be able to remove existing terms from the glossary when no longer relevant.
- Lexify.md shall provide functionality to update definitions of existing terms in the glossary.

### 4.3 Linkification (Nice to Have)
- Lexify.md shall automatically create links to glossary terms within project documentation when invoked.

## 5. Non-Functional Requirements

### 5.1 Usability
- Lexify.md shall be intuitive and easy to use for developers with varying levels of command-line experience.
- The tool shall provide clear and concise instructions for usage and error handling.

### 5.2 Performance
- Lexify.md shall respond to user inputs within milliseconds under normal operating conditions.
- The tool shall handle concurrent user requests efficiently without degradation in performance.

### 5.3 Reliability
- Lexify.md shall be robust and resilient to errors, minimizing the risk of crashes or data corruption.
- The tool shall provide mechanisms for data backup and recovery in case of unexpected failures.

## 6. Constraints

### 6.1 Technical Constraints
- Lexify.md shall be developed using Python programming language and standard libraries.
- The tool shall be compatible with major operating systems including Windows, macOS, and Linux.

### 6.2 Time Constraints
- The development of Lexify.md shall be completed within three months.
- The tool shall undergo testing and quality assurance processes prior to release.

## 7. Assumptions and Dependencies

### 7.1 Assumptions
- Users have basic knowledge of command-line interfaces and terminal commands.
- The glossary file format and structure are predefined and consistent across projects.

### 7.2 Dependencies
- The successful deployment of Lexify.md relies on access to the project repository and permissions to modify project documentation.


# Scratchpad

- There is an easy to use file format that can hold on to a medium size glossary and can be viewed as part of the code using very common tools.
